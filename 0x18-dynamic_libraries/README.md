Dynamic libraries in C provide a flexible and efficient way to share code among multiple programs. Unlike static libraries, dynamic libraries are loaded into a program's memory at runtime, allowing for more modular and space-efficient code distribution. They consist of precompiled, reusable functions and procedures that can be linked to applications dynamically. Dynamic libraries enhance code maintainability by centralizing common functionality, and updates to the library automatically propagate to all applications linked to it. This approach reduces redundancy in code storage and allows for more straightforward version management. Additionally, dynamic libraries contribute to faster application startup times and support features like runtime loading and unloading. Overall, the use of dynamic libraries in C promotes code reusability, modularity, and efficient resource utilization across diverse software projects.
