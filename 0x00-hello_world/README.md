A "C - Hello, World" repository is a simple and foundational programming example. It typically contains the source code for a basic C program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. This program is often the first program beginners write when learning a new programming language, as it introduces them to the language's syntax and the concept of program execution. These repositories serve as a starting point for learning C programming and provide a hands-on introduction to the language's fundamentals.
